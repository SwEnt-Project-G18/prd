# Non-Functional Requirements

## Security, privacy, and data retention policies

<!---*Which are the applicable laws and regulations?*

*What are your internal policies?*

*Which privacy features do you need from the phone?*--->

Sensible Data :

- Localisation, not uploaded to our services
- Chat content, managed by Stream
- Private event, need to ensure privacy



## Adoptions, Scalability and Availability

<!---*What kind of traffic patterns do you expect to see?*

*Are there known periods of bursty traffic that the MVP must be designed to support?*--->

Inclusion of a ticketing sytem leaves us open to massive connection spikes at initial sales for big events. 
This need to be discussed more before finalising MVP functional requirements.
