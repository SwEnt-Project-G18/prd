# Analysis of the Situation

*What are the competing products in the market today?*

*What are the complementary products in the market today?*

We have asserted that conventional social media apps do not fulfill the needs of college students.
Students tend to attend a lot of different and not necessarily regularly scheduled events aside from classes. Examples are: work group meetings, meetings with TAs or project supervisors, conferences, friendly gathering, social and cultural events.
Having a single center to manage all these occurence is key to reducing the work it takes to stay organised.

As event organisers, a lot of problems need to be solved :
- Easily sharing the event 
- Managing the attendance of the event
- Communicating information to attendees
- Taking reservation and/or payments

Our main competition here is standard communications applications (Whatsapp, Telegram). We aim to differentiate ourselves by providing specific functionalities aimed at event organisation. 

Examples :
- Ticket management
- Map based discovery
