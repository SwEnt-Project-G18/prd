# Analysis of the Situation

## Market Needs and Gaps

We have asserted that conventional social media apps do not fulfill the specific needs of college students. Students frequently attend various events that are not necessarily regularly scheduled, such as:

- **Work Group Meetings:** Often require quick coordination and location sharing among team members.
- **Meetings with TAs or Project Supervisors:** Need a structured way to organize and remind participants.
- **Conferences:** Require detailed event information and communication tools.
- **Friendly Gatherings:** Benefit from informal invitation and event sharing methods.
- **Social and Cultural Events:** Require easy discovery and sharing features.

Currently, these events are often organized and communicated through informal means, such as Telegram channels. While effective for communication, these platforms lack the dedicated event management tools that can streamline the process and improve overall coordination. 

GoMeet aims to fill this gap by providing an all-in-one solution that combines the ease of communication found in messaging apps with the robust event management features needed for organizing various types of events. This will cater specifically to the dynamic and diverse needs of college students, enhancing their ability to efficiently plan and participate in events.
