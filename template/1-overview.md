GoMeet is an app centered around the creation and organisation of live event. From concert and festivals, to work meeting or conferences, the goal of the app is to allow easy sharing and planification to meet with others in real life.

- As a user we provide a map based view of major public events
- As an organiser we provide easy interface to create public and private event as well as manage the invitee list

A key point is the ease of sharing real life event information as easily as possible, to make the app a tool to enable real life socialisation rather than a social media platform.
