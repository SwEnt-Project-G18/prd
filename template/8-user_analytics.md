## Goal

The primary goal is to understand how users are interacting with the GoMeet app and to measure its penetration and acceptance within the EPFL userbase, particularly among college students and student associations.

## Key Metrics

1. **User Penetration:**
   - Number of active users from the EPFL community.
   - Percentage of EPFL students who have downloaded and registered on the app.

2. **Event Creation and Participation:**
   - Number of events created on the app.
   - Number of attendees per event.
   - Types of events being created (public vs. private).

3. **Engagement Rates:**
   - Frequency of app usage (daily, weekly, monthly active users).
   - Average session duration.
   - Number of interactions per user (messages sent, invites accepted, events joined).

4. **Adoption by Student Associations:**
   - Number of student associations using the app.
   - Number of events organized by these associations through the app.
   - Feedback and satisfaction levels from these associations.

5. **Feature Utilization:**
   - Usage rates of key features (map view, trends screen, QR code sharing, chat, notifications).
   - User feedback on these features.

## Success Criteria

1. **High Penetration Rate:**
   - Aim for at least 50% of the EPFL student body to be active users within the first six months.

2. **Adoption by Student Associations:**
   - Secure the participation of at least 70% of the EPFL student associations in using the app for event management.

3. **High Engagement Levels:**
   - Target an average of at least 2 events created per user per month.
   - Ensure at least 75% of users engage with the app weekly.

4. **Positive User Feedback:**
   - Achieve a user satisfaction score of 80% or higher based on in-app surveys and feedback forms.

## Analysis Plan

### Data Collection

1. **In-App Analytics:**
   - Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user behavior and engagement.
   - Collect data on user interactions, event creation, participation rates, and feature utilization.

2. **User Surveys and Feedback:**
   - Conduct regular surveys to gather qualitative feedback from users.
   - Use feedback forms to identify pain points and areas for improvement.

3. **Adoption Tracking:**
   - Monitor the number of downloads and registrations from the EPFL domain.
   - Track the number of student associations registering and actively using the app.

### Data Analysis

1. **Usage Patterns:**
   - Analyze patterns of app usage to understand peak times, popular features, and common user journeys.
   - Identify trends in event creation and participation.

2. **Engagement Metrics:**
   - Evaluate engagement metrics to determine user retention rates and overall satisfaction.
   - Compare engagement rates across different user segments (e.g., students vs. associations).

3. **Feedback Analysis:**
   - Analyze survey and feedback data to gauge user satisfaction and identify areas needing improvement.
   - Prioritize feature requests and bug fixes based on user feedback.

## A/B Testing Ideas

1. **Event Creation Process:**
   - Test different versions of the event creation interface to find the most user-friendly and efficient design.
   - Measure the impact on the number of events created and user satisfaction.

2. **Notification Settings:**
   - Experiment with different notification settings and frequencies to find the optimal balance that keeps users informed without being intrusive.
   - Track the impact on user engagement and retention.

3. **Recommendation Algorithm:**
   - Test variations of the recommendation algorithm to determine which approach provides the most relevant event suggestions.
   - Monitor user interaction with recommended events and overall satisfaction.

4. **Onboarding Experience:**
   - A/B test different onboarding flows to see which approach leads to higher user retention and faster adoption.
   - Analyze the impact on user engagement and feature adoption.

By focusing on these metrics and analysis plans, we can ensure that GoMeet effectively meets the needs of the EPFL student community and achieves high levels of user adoption and satisfaction.
