# The Value Proposition

<!---*Describe the value proposition and argue that it is:*

*1. Easy to communicate*

*2. Defensible*

*3. Relevant*-->

Our core idea is to create a single portal to ensure



As event organisers, a lot of problems need to be solved :
- Easily sharing the event 
- Managing the attendance of the event
- Communicating information to attendees
- Taking reservation and/or payments

For attendees : 
- Simple way to find new events to join
- User friendly interface for info and joining
- Right on time Notifications to be reminded of your schedule
- Rating system to see if events are worth attending
