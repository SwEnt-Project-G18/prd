The V1 Proof of Concept was develloped during the Spring 2024 Software Entreprise class. It focuses on bringing the most basic building blocks necessary for the creation and organisation of event, as well as the technical backbone of the app. 

Basic functions are: 

- Creating for both private and public events
- Event discovery through the map and the trends page
- Event sharing through QR codes and friends invite
- Information sharing through chat and Event update posts
