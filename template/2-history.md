## V1 Proof of Concept (PoC)

The V1 Proof of Concept (PoC) for GoMeet was developed during the Spring 2024 Software Enterprise class. This initial version focused on establishing the fundamental building blocks required for creating and organizing events, along with laying down the technical backbone of the app. The goal was to create a functional prototype that could demonstrate the core features and potential of GoMeet.

### Basic Functions

The V1 PoC included the following basic functions:

- **Event Creation:** Users could create both private and public events, providing a foundation for event management within the app.
- **Event Discovery:** Through an interactive map and a trends page, users could discover events happening in their vicinity, making it easy to find activities of interest.
- **Event Sharing:** Users could share event details using QR codes and invite friends to join events, facilitating easy dissemination of event information.
- **Information Sharing:** A chat feature and event update posts allowed users to communicate and share updates about events, ensuring attendees were well-informed.

### Learnings from V1 PoC

From the development and testing of the V1 PoC, several key learnings emerged:

1. **User Engagement:** Users appreciated the ease of event creation and the interactive map for event discovery, highlighting the importance of a user-friendly interface.
2. **Social Integration:** The ability to invite friends and share events via QR codes was well-received, indicating the value of social features in driving user engagement.
3. **Communication Needs:** The chat feature was essential for event coordination, but users expressed a need for more robust communication tools, such as group chats and notification systems.
4. **Technical Stability:** The technical backbone proved to be stable, but scalability and performance improvements were identified as necessary for handling larger user bases and more complex functionalities.

### Bridging PoC to MVP

To transition from the PoC to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the following enhancements and additional features are needed:

1. **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the overall user experience with a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.
2. **Scalability:** Optimize the app's backend to ensure it can handle increased user traffic and more complex operations.
3. **Advanced Communication Tools:** Implement group chats, real-time notifications, and a more sophisticated messaging system to meet users' communication needs.
4. **Expanded Event Features:** Add more detailed event management options, such as ticketing, attendee management, and event analytics.
5. **User Profiles and Interests:** Allow users to create detailed profiles and specify interests, enhancing the social networking aspect of the app.
6. **Security and Privacy:** Strengthen security measures and privacy settings to protect user data and ensure a safe user experience.

By addressing these areas, GoMeet can evolve from a PoC to an MVP, ready to meet the needs of a broader user base and provide a comprehensive platform for event creation and management.
